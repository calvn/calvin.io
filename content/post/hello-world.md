I haven't kept up with a blog/personal site since my beginnings with [ForgeFun](http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://forgefun.com), where I used to post weekend-sized hardware/electronics projects. Even though it was a few years ago, I still remember how fun it was to spend a weekend or two working on a project and then sharing it in the site.
