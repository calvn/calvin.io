Iâ€™m a graduate from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute with bachelor's degree in Computer & Systems Engineering and Computer Science. 

I was previously on the [Cimpress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cimpress) infrastructure team working on automation, deployment, and service discovery. I was also part of the API Management team, and worked on identity and access management used for authentication and authorization on REST services.

I'm currently part of the [Hashicorp](https://www.hashicorp.com) organization, more specifically within the [Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io) team.

Working towards making people's lives easier, one line at a time.
